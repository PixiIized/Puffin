## About
Puffin is a simple programming language that sprung forth from the creator's mind when she said<br>
"Hold on a damn second. There's no language called Puffin."

And so was spun a tale of stupidity and questionable syntax- all to bring forth to you, <b>Puffin</b>.<br>

## Features
I offer to you:

- **Readable Syntax** - I hate those clunky symbols
- **References** - Not pointers I gotta make that clear
- **Static Typing** - Screw you TypeScript, I can do it too
- **List and Matrices** - Hold on, what bonehead put that in this list?? That's basic shi-
- **Fantastically Bad Syntax** - Designed for optimal suffering

```
.Example!!!
let string hullo :: 'Hullo, world!';
output(hullo);
```
`> Hullo, world!`

And it's only ~~$599.99~~ completely free!!!

## How To Use
Currently a Python prototype; stay tuned for the first usable interpreter!<br>
I'll make a doc once it's usable.<br>
If people like this dookie of a language I'll remake it in rust so we can spread the suffering.

## FAQ
> Why??

Whatever your poor sweet innocent soul desires
