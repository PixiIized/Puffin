## About
Puffin is my own programming language made using Python (for now). It's simple, consistent, and somewhat logical. I did, however, decide to ignore all known conventions for existing programming languages. This thing is one of a kind. Puffin is currently in development, but new features are being added whenever I feel like it. This language is written completely from scratch with no outside tools, which may explain a bit of the jankiness. This readme, however, is blatantly plagiarized from another custom language someone else made, called Pinecone.

If you want to program using Puffin, then I'm quite sorry, but it's not yet usable.

Tutorials will be available upon the first usable release of the language.

## Example
While you can't code with it, the syntax is basically already set in stone.

Here's a simple "hello world" program in Puffin.
```
.Hullo World
output('Hullo, world!');
```
This will return `Hullo, world!`.

Here's the usual fizzbuzz script written in Puffin. It cycles through numbers 1 to 20, returning "fizz" if it's a multiple of 3, "buzz" if a multiple of 5, and "fizzbuzz" if both.
```
.fizzbuzz

.call the function
fuzzBuzz(1, 20);

.the function
fizzBuzz(start, end):
  for i, start, end:
    if i % 3 = 0 and i % 5 = 0:
      output('fizzbuzz');
    elif i % 3 = 0:
      output('fizz');
    elif i % 5 = 0:
      output('buzz');
    else:
      output(i);
    end;
  end;
end;
```

## Wait, but why?
Short answer?
Cause I could.

Longer answer?
Cause I though Puffin would make a good language name, and didn't want someone to take it.

Longest answer?
I wanted to make my own programming language so I could get a better feel for how they operate, why things do what they do, how I could iterate and improve.
Puffin doesn't fill any niche, and the syntax is questionable at best- it's really just here.

## Features
Currently, all I have working is the lexer. Check back another time!

## Contributing
I'm not great at coding- you might be! Create all the issues you want, and feel free to make any pull requests. I always love improvements. And don't worry- you'll receive credit.
